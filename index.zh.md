## Official Manual

This page is the Genie PHP official manual. Official manuals are open source. The documentation hub hub repository is `https: // github.com / jinyphp / docs`. Anyone can participate in the supplement of the contents of the manual. You can fix it after you `fork` the feather hub. Please send us a pull request after revision and we will check and correct the revision. You can also upload videos by linking with the manual production participation.

## Creation format 
--- 
Genie PHP manuals can be created using HTML and Markdown syntax. Most development documents are written in mark-down format. Default documents are also provided in a mark-down format. 

<br> 
## Multi-language processing 
--- 
Manual can be written in multiple languages. This is because Genie PHP is a `web framework &#39;that supports multilingual systems. When you write multilingual, you should write `document name, language code, extension &#39;type. The default language is Korean.
